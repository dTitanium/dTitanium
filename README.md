### 🌏 Enhancing Pedestrian Safety in Melbourne's Urban Areas
This project focuses on improving pedestrian safety in Melbourne by leveraging geospatial data and analytical tools to evaluate the steepness of urban footpaths. It provides insights for urban planners and pedestrians to enhance walkability and safety in the city's public spaces.

#### 🗝️ Key Highlights
- **🗺️ Interactive Maps**:
  - Visual representation of footpath steepness across Melbourne.
  - Color-coded paths to indicate varying levels of steepness.
- **📍 Route Optimization**:
  - Suggests safer routes with minimal steepness for pedestrians.

#### 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- 🐍 Python (Geospatial libraries like `geopandas`, `shapely`)
- 🗺️ OpenRouteService API
- 📓 Jupyter Notebook
- 📊 Data visualization (`matplotlib`, `folium`)

#### 📌 Current Status
- ✅ Data analysis and visualization completed.
- 🔄 Actively exploring expansion to other cities and additional accessibility factors.
